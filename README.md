# Garment-Fitting-Virtual-Try-on-using-cGAN-s

## Project Overview
This repository hosts the code and resources for an advanced Image-based Virtual Try-On (VTON) system. The project is built around a novel implementation of a three-stage Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN). Our aim was to significantly enhance the realism of virtual garment fitting, providing a more accurate and user-friendly experience for online shopping.

### Key Features:
- **Three-Stage cGAN Architecture**: The model architecture is divided into coarse generation, warping, and refinement stages, each contributing to the overall effectiveness and realism of the virtual try-on process.
- **Enhanced Realism**: The system is specifically designed to handle the complex task of accurately fitting virtual garments onto various body types in different poses, ensuring a realistic representation.

## Project Outcome
The project achieved notable success, as evidenced by our results:

- **Frechet Inception Distance (FID) Score**: The system attained a FID score of 36.382, indicating its efficiency in generating high-quality images that closely resemble real-life photographs.
- **Implications for the Fashion Industry**: This development is set to revolutionize the online shopping experience, potentially reducing product returns and saving on shipping costs by allowing customers to accurately visualize garments on themselves.
